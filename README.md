# Twitter Case Study: Using Natural Language Processing to Classify Tweet Sentiments Towards Climate Change

## Context
Businesses who position themselves as "green" or provide products that lessen their customers' environmental effect face a risk if they fail to conduct sufficient market research in the face of an apparent increase in skepticism regarding climate change. It is necessary to develop a machine learning model that can categorize people's beliefs on climate change based on their unique twitter data in order to supplement the present market research initiatives.

## Expected Outcomes
1. Determine Twitter trends
2. Develop a methodology to categorize attitudes about climate change
3. Create an application that makes the model easy to use.
4. Share findings with interested parties


## Tools Used
Python
Streamlit
scikit-learn
nltk
Comet
GitHub
AWS EC2

## Output
an SVC model with an accuracy of 0.76105 on the F1-score. We were ranked 15th out of 293 teams on the Kaggle leaderboard as a result.
