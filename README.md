# Twitter Case Study: Using Natural Language Processing to Classify Tweet Sentiments Towards Climate Change

## Context
Businesses who position themselves as "green" or provide products that lessen their customers' environmental effect face a risk if they fail to conduct sufficient market research in the face of an apparent increase in skepticism regarding climate change. It is necessary to develop a machine learning model that can categorize people's beliefs on climate change based on their unique twitter data in order to supplement the present market research initiatives.

## Expected Outcomes
1. Determine Twitter trends
2. Develop a methodology to categorize attitudes about climate change
3. Create an application that makes the model easy to use.
4. Share findings with interested parties


## Tools Used
- Python
- Streamlit
- scikit-learn
- nltk
- Comet
- GitHub
- AWS EC2

## Output
- an SVC model with an accuracy of 0.76105 on the F1-score. We were ranked 15th out of 293 teams on the Kaggle leaderboard as a result.

## Conclusions
1. The great bulk of Tweets are in favor of addressing climate change.
2. There is minimal distinction in vocabulary between individuals who support and oppose climate change. It could be that a lot of people are attempting to discuss popular subjects and hashtags, which is why the most commonly used terms over an extended period of time would be the same.
## Recommendations
1. Since the majority of tweets on Twitter are created by those who believe in climate change, businesses can target these individuals in order to increase support and retweets.
2. Based on current trends, a technology that automatically distinguishes phrases used by people who believe in climate change from those who do not should be developed, as the distinctions seem to be trend-dependent but fade over longer time horizons. In order to target their target market, marketers would be able to find essential phrases through this.
